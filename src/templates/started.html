  <p>
    The Blob Migration Pipeline has been started.
  </p>

  {{ macros.mrstatus(root_pipeline_id) }}

  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong>
    This migration tool will start secondary pipelines for large files,
    so even though this pipeline may be complete, secondary pipelines
    may still be migrating files. Check your queues and logs to follow
    progress.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    the BlobInfo.all() query is eventually consistent. You may wish to re-run
    this migration tool at a later time to pickup any blobs that were missed
    due to eventual consistency (or if you find additional code that
    was writing to Blobstore and need to migrate newly created blobs).
    This tool will skip over any previously migrated blobs.
